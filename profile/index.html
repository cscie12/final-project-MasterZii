            Overview:
        </h2>
        <p>
            As a Sr. dev, I hold experience in back-end web tech and other creative fields.
            <br>
            My background is diverse, extending into the realms of 3D design and game development.
            <br>
            These skills being atop my foundation in UX design and accessibility – which I am currently furthering through graduate studies.
            <br>
            I have a passion for engaging in Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and have assisted in founding a new ERG in Accessibility, as well as being the lead of an LGBTQ+ ERG.
            <br>
            I’m always eager to dive into challenging new projects.

            UX is a major component in what I do. Whether it be designing UI's for web interfaces or games, creating product prototypes, or making other everyday tools more acessible for a wider audience.
            <br>
            I find something to look forward to improving for any project I am put on.
            <br>
            My preference is fast-paced enviroments with lots of variations in things to work on!

        <p>
            I love games, whether it be tabletop of video games!
            <br>
            I enjoy learning new skills and enjoy creative hobbies (art, music, game dev, building, cratfs, etc). I hope my future partner likes to push themselves as much as I do, and we can encourage each other!
            <br>
            On top of being a software analyst, I'm also a digital artist and game developer. You can check out some of my artwork on the website @ art.dev
            <br>
            I love creating renders in a <a href="../works/index.html">vaporwave</a> style!
            <br>
            I'm a huge animal lover, but I prefer the unusual or exotic.
            <br>
            Above all, I love birds. I have a 64yr old house and I am working on renovating it, so doing a lot of DIY work.
            <br>
            I'm very creative when it comes to finding solutions to some of the problems I face in life!
